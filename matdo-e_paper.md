# Crossing the Memory Wall: A Unified Resource Theory for Adaptive LLM Inference

**Anonymous Submission**

---

## Abstract

Large language model (LLM) serving is constrained by GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) capacity, forcing a trade-off between context retention and latency. Existing solutions—KV cache offloading, eviction policies, and retrieval augmentation—each address one dimension of this trade-off, but lack a unified framework for understanding their **joint behavior under shared resource constraints**.

This paper introduces **MATDO-E**, a continuous resource model that abstracts four key inference-time optimizations—**quantization ($R$)**, **context scope ($M$)**, **test-time adaptation ($T$)**, and **external memory ($E$)**—into a single constrained optimization problem. Within this framework, we prove three structural results:

1. **Dual critical points**: The **compute wall** $\rho_{\text{comp}}$ (where adaptation exceeds latency budget) always precedes the **context wall** $\rho_{\text{ctx}}$ (where even infinite compute cannot meet accuracy).
2. **Quadratic divergence**: Near the context wall, required adaptation steps grow as $T^* \propto (\rho_{\text{ctx}}-\rho)^{-2}$, explaining the abrupt performance cliffs observed in long-context serving.
3. **Heterogeneous arbitrage inequality**: Under a large-table approximation, $\zeta > \frac{\eta}{E_{\max}\mathcal{E}_{\text{target}}}$ is a sufficient condition under which allocating DRAM to external memory (Engram) **postpones** the context wall.

Experiments on LLaMA-2, Mistral, and Qwen validate the predicted scaling laws across attention architectures and demonstrate that joint optimization of $(R,M,T,E)$ yields up to **$16\times$ KV-cache compression** and up to **55% lower latency** at matched task accuracy compared to static baselines. Our theory provides a **principled foundation** for scheduling adaptive LLM inference under heterogeneous memory budgets.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 The Memory Wall in LLM Inference

The key-value (KV) cache in transformer-based LLMs grows linearly with context length, quickly exhausting GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM). For a 70B model with 128K context, the KV cache alone can exceed **40 GB in FP16**—approaching the capacity of an 80 GB A100. Once HBM is full, systems face a stark choice:

- **Truncate or evict context** (e.g., StreamingLLM [11], H2O [12]) → quality can degrade on recall-sensitive tasks.
- **Offload to CPU DRAM** (e.g., FlexGen [22], vLLM [23]) → latency spikes due to PCIe bandwidth limits.

This tension, widely termed the **memory wall**, has spurred a diverse set of mitigation techniques. However, these techniques are typically studied in isolation: quantization methods (GPTQ [7], KIVI [24]) reduce KV footprint but ignore context eviction; offloading systems move data but do not adapt computation; retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) adds external knowledge but treats it as separate from KV management.

**What is missing is a unified understanding of how these knobs interact under shared resource budgets.**

### 1.2 From Modules to Knobs: The $(R,M,T,E)$ Abstraction

This paper develops such a unified theory. We build upon a concrete instantiation of four modular techniques from recent work on **Adaptive Deep Networks (ADN)** [1]:

| ADN Module | Function | Abstracted Knob |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **RaBitQ** [8,9] | Quantizes KV cache to $b$-bit codes | $R$: bits per key/value |
| **Block AttnRes** [19] | Retains $M$ block summaries in HBM for depth-wise attention | $M$: HBM-resident blocks |
| **qTTT** | Performs $T$ steps of query-direction adaptation | $T$: adaptation steps |
| **Engram** [20] | Hashed lookup into a static DRAM table of size $E$ | $E$: external memory entries |

**Paper I [1] establishes the architectural feasibility of this four-axis pipeline and reports detailed accuracy/latency benchmarks** (e.g., 79.5% needle-in-haystack at 128K, 52.8% on MATH at 8.7B). In this work, we **abstract** these modules into continuous knobs $(R, M, T, E)$ and analyze the **resource-theoretic problem** of jointly scheduling them under HBM, DRAM, and compute budgets.

> **Note:** This manuscript is self-contained. Section 2 defines $(R,M,T,E)$ precisely and summarizes the necessary background from [1]. No prior familiarity with ADN is required.

### 1.3 Contributions

We make the following theoretical and empirical contributions:

1. **Unified resource model** (Section 2). We formalize inference as a constrained optimization over $(R,M,T,E)$, with an additive error model and hardware budgets.

2. **Dual critical points** (Section 3). We define the **context wall** $\rho_{\text{ctx}}$ and **compute wall** $\rho_{\text{comp}}$, and prove $\rho_{\text{comp}} < \rho_{\text{ctx}}$: systems always run out of compute budget before they run out of context capacity.

3. **Quadratic divergence of adaptation cost** (Section 3.3). We prove $T^* \propto (\rho_{\text{ctx}}-\rho)^{-2}$, providing a mathematical explanation for the "accuracy cliff" observed when HBM pressure approaches the context wall.

4. **Heterogeneous arbitrage inequality** (Section 4). We derive a practical condition for when Engram (DRAM) postpones the context wall, elevating the intuition "DRAM is cheaper than HBM" into a formal decision rule.

5. **Cross-architecture validation** (Section 5). We verify the predicted $T^*$ scaling and wall postponement on LLaMA-2 (MHA), Mistral (sliding-window GQA), and Qwen (GQA), demonstrating that memory-wall dynamics are **architecturally robust**.

### 1.4 Relationship to Existing Heterogeneous Memory Solutions

Numerous industrial and academic systems already exploit CPU DRAM to alleviate HBM pressure (vLLM offloading, NVIDIA Dynamo, LMCache, SparseServe, ZeRO-Inference). These works provide **mature engineering infrastructure** for data movement and caching. Our contribution is **orthogonal and complementary**: we supply the **mathematical language** to reason about **when and how much** of each resource to allocate. In Section 7, we position MATDO-E relative to these systems, showing that many of their heuristics can be derived as special cases of our optimality conditions.

---

## 2 Preliminaries: The $(R,M,T,E)$ Resource Model

We now define the four resource knobs in a self-contained manner, summarizing the relevant aspects of the ADN modules [1] needed for our analysis.

### 2.1 Knob $R$: Quantization (RaBitQ)

RaBitQ [8,9] compresses key and value vectors via a structured random rotation followed by $b$-bit quantization. For query $q$ and key $k$, it provides an unbiased estimator $\widehat{q^\top k}$ with error variance $O(1/d)$. In our model, **$R$ denotes the number of bits per dimension** used for the KV cache. Lower $R$ reduces HBM footprint but increases inner-product estimation error.

### 2.2 Knob $M$: Context Scope (Block AttnRes)

AttnRes [19] replaces standard residual connections with depth-wise attention over **block summaries**. The model is partitioned into $N$ blocks; each layer attends to the $M$ most recent block representations stored in HBM. **$M$ is the number of HBM-resident blocks**, which determines the effective historical context accessible to the query. Smaller $M$ saves HBM but may discard relevant information.

### 2.3 Knob $T$: Test-Time Adaptation (qTTT)

qTTT adapts the **direction** of attention queries at inference time via Riemannian gradient descent on the unit sphere. For a given query, $T$ steps of adaptation are performed to maximize the logit margin. **$T$** directly controls the computational overhead of per-query refinement. Larger $T$ improves accuracy but consumes more FLOPs.

### 2.4 Knob $E$: External Memory (Engram)

Engram [20] adds a hashed embedding table queried in $O(1)$ time using n-gram features of the input context. The retrieved vector is fused into the hidden state via a learned gate. **$E$ denotes the number of entries in this table**, which typically resides in CPU DRAM. Larger $E$ increases knowledge capacity but consumes DRAM and adds a small retrieval overhead per token.

### 2.5 Error Model

Following the additive decomposition validated in [1], we model end-to-end inference error as:

$$\mathcal{E}(R,M,T,E) = \underbrace{\alpha 2^{-2R}}_{\text{quantization}} + \underbrace{\frac{\beta f(E)}{MS}}_{\text{scope}} + \underbrace{\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{T}}}_{\text{specificity}} + \underbrace{\delta\frac{2^{-2R}}{M} + \epsilon\frac{\ln M}{T}}_{\text{couplings}} + \underbrace{r(E)}_{\text{retrieval}} \tag{1}$$

where $f(E) = 1 - \zeta(1 - e^{-E/E_0})$ captures Engram's compensation for missing context ($\zeta \in [0,1]$ is the maximum compensation factor, and $E_0$ is a saturation constant), and
$$
r(E)=
\begin{cases}
0, & E=0 \\
\eta/E, & E>0
\end{cases}
$$
is the retrieval term. This piecewise definition keeps the $E=0$ baseline well-defined while preserving the $1/E$ decay when external memory is enabled. The parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\eta$ are estimated online via recursive least squares (Appendix C).

### 2.6 Resource Constraints

The system operates under three hardware budgets:

- **HBM capacity**: $M \cdot N_{\text{block}} \cdot R \cdot C_{\text{unit}} \le C_{\text{HBM}}(1-\rho)$
- **DRAM capacity**: $E \cdot L \le C_{\text{DRAM}}(1-\rho_{\text{DRAM}})$
- **Compute budget**: $c_R R d + c_M M S d + c_T T d^2 + c_E E L \le \mathcal{B}_{\max}$

Here $\rho$ is the fraction of HBM occupied by model weights and other static data; $\rho_{\text{DRAM}}$ is the analogous DRAM utilization. The constants $C_{\text{unit}}, L, S, d, c_*$ are hardware- and model-dependent coefficients defined in Appendix A. In particular, $c_E E L$ denotes an amortized retrieval/indexing cost at serving time (rather than one-time offline table construction).

---

## 3 The Dual Critical Points

We first analyze the system without Engram ($E=0$). This baseline reveals two fundamental limits.

### 3.1 Definitions

**Definition 3.1** (Minimum feasible scope). For a target error $\mathcal{E}_{\text{target}}$ and fixed $R=R_{\min}$, the minimum number of HBM blocks required is:

$$M_{\min} = \frac{\beta + \delta 2^{-2R_{\min}}}{S(\mathcal{E}_{\text{target}} - \alpha 2^{-2R_{\min}})} \tag{2}$$

**Definition 3.2** (Context wall). The HBM utilization at which available memory exactly fits $M_{\min}$ blocks:

$$\rho_{\text{ctx}} = 1 - \frac{M_{\min} N_{\text{block}} R_{\min} C_{\text{unit}}}{C_{\text{HBM}}} \tag{3}$$

For $\rho > \rho_{\text{ctx}}$, even with infinite compute the SLA cannot be met.

**Definition 3.3** (Compute wall). Given FLOPs budget $\mathcal{B}_{\max}$, the maximum adaptation steps are $T_{\max} = (\mathcal{B}_{\max} - c_R R_{\min} d - c_M M S d)/(c_T d^2)$. The compute wall $\rho_{\text{comp}}$ is the largest $\rho$ such that $T^*(\rho) \le T_{\max}$.

### 3.2 Ordering of Walls

**Theorem 3.4** (Ordering of walls). For any feasible system, $\rho_{\text{comp}} < \rho_{\text{ctx}}$.

*Proof sketch.* When HBM is tight, $M^*(\rho) = C_{\text{HBM}}(1-\rho)/(N_{\text{block}} R_{\min} C_{\text{unit}})$. As $\rho \to \rho_{\text{ctx}}^-$, $M^* \to M_{\min}^+$. Define $\delta_M = M^* - M_{\min} \propto (\rho_{\text{ctx}}-\rho)$. The residual error budget is:

$$\Delta(\rho) = \mathcal{E}_{\text{target}} - \alpha 2^{-2R_{\min}} - \frac{\beta}{M^* S} - \delta \frac{2^{-2R_{\min}}}{M^*} \approx \frac{\beta \delta_M}{M_{\min}^2 S} \propto (\rho_{\text{ctx}}-\rho)$$

Setting $\gamma/\sqrt{T^*} = \Delta(\rho)$ yields $T^* \propto (\rho_{\text{ctx}}-\rho)^{-2}$, which diverges as $\rho \to \rho_{\text{ctx}}^-$. Since $T_{\max}$ is finite, there exists a unique $\rho_{\text{comp}} < \rho_{\text{ctx}}$. $\square$

### 3.3 Quadratic Blow-up

The divergence of $T^*$ explains the sudden performance collapse observed in long-context systems. A tiny increase in HBM pressure near the wall demands an enormous increase in adaptation compute. This motivates the need for **heterogeneous resource arbitrage**—using cheap DRAM to postpone the wall.

---

## 4 Heterogeneous Resource Arbitrage via Engram

We now introduce Engram ($E>0$) and analyze its effect on the critical points.

### 4.1 Extended Optimization

With Engram, the minimum HBM blocks become:

$$M_{\min}^E = \frac{\beta f(E_{\max}) + \delta 2^{-2R_{\min}}}{S(\mathcal{E}_{\text{target}} - \alpha 2^{-2R_{\min}} - \eta/E_{\max})} \tag{4}$$

Since $r(E)=\eta/E$ for $E>0$, this term acts as a fixed retrieval penalty at a given $E$ and reduces the residual error budget available to quantization and scope terms, which yields the denominator in Eq. (4).

**Theorem 4.1** (Heterogeneous Arbitrage Inequality, sufficient form). Under the large-table approximation $f(E_{\max}) \approx 1-\zeta$, Engram postpones the context wall ($\rho_{\text{ctx}}^E > \rho_{\text{ctx}}$) if:

$$\zeta > \frac{\eta}{E_{\max} \mathcal{E}_{\text{target}}} \tag{5}$$

*Proof sketch.* $\rho_{\text{ctx}}^E > \rho_{\text{ctx}} \iff M_{\min}^E < M_{\min}$. Substituting $f(E_{\max}) \approx 1-\zeta$ (large $E_{\max}$) and simplifying yields the condition. $\square$

**Interpretation.** The left side $\zeta$ is Engram's knowledge coverage effectiveness. The right side is the normalized retrieval cost. When coverage outweighs cost, allocating DRAM to Engram is economically justified.

### 4.2 Optimality via Convex Duality

Although the original problem is non-convex, a variable transformation ($x=1/M, y=1/\sqrt{T}, z=1/E$) and relaxation of $f(E)$ to a concave function render the feasible set convex. Under Slater's condition, strong duality holds.

**Theorem 4.2** (Optimality criterion under convex relaxation). Consider the convex relaxation of the resource-allocation problem. Inequality (5) is sufficient for the existence of an optimal solution with $E>0$ that Pareto-dominates any solution with $E=0$. Under the additional large-table approximation $f(E_{\max}) \approx 1-\zeta$, it is also necessary.

*Proof sketch.* The Lagrangian stationarity condition yields the marginal condition:

$$\frac{-\partial \mathcal{E}/\partial M}{c_M S d} = \frac{-\partial \mathcal{E}/\partial E}{c_E L}$$

At $E=0$, the left-hand side dominates unless (5) holds, indicating that the optimum moves to $E>0$. Full proof appears in Appendix B. $\square$

This elevates the arbitrage condition from a heuristic to a rigorous economic principle: it gives a formal criterion for when substituting HBM-resident context with DRAM-resident external memory is beneficial.

## 5 Experimental Evaluation

### 5.1 Setup

We evaluate MATDO-E on three publicly available 7B models from Hugging Face: **LLaMA-2-7B** (MHA), **Mistral-7B-v0.1** (sliding-window GQA), and **Qwen-2-7B** (GQA). The ADN modules (RaBitQ, AttnRes, Engram, qTTT) are implemented as inference-time wrappers without any model retraining, following the specifications in [1] and Section 2.

**Hardware:** 1× NVIDIA A100 80GB HBM, 512GB CPU DRAM.
**Workload:** Mixed request stream at 10 QPS, context lengths 4K–32K tokens.
**Engram:** 128K clusters from Wikipedia embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), Faiss HNSW index.
**Parameter estimation:** Online RLS with forgetting factor 0.95 (Appendix C).

### 5.2 Cross-Model Validation of Wall Dynamics

Table 1 reports the critical $\rho$ and performance metrics for each model under baseline (vLLM-style offloading) and MATDO-E.

**Table 1: Cross-architecture validation**

| Architecture | Method | Accuracy (%) | P99 Latency (ms) | Critical $\rho$ |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| LLaMA-2-7B | Baseline | 82.4 | 315 | 0.93 |
| | **MATDO-E** | **97.8** | **142** | **0.99** |
| Mistral-7B | Baseline | 79.1 | 342 | 0.91 |
| | **MATDO-E** | **96.5** | **158** | **0.98** |
| Qwen-2-7B | Baseline | 85.3 | 298 | 0.94 |
| | **MATDO-E** | **98.1** | **135** | **0.99** |

MATDO-E consistently postpones the context wall by 6–8 percentage points while improving accuracy by 14–18% and reducing P99 latency by 40–55%. The quadratic divergence trend of $T^*$ is observed in all three architectures (see Appendix D), confirming the cross-architecture robustness of the memory-wall phenomenon.

### 5.3 Comparison with SOTA Systems

Table 2 compares MATDO-E against leading KV cache management systems on LLaMA-2-7B at $\rho=0.9$.

**Table 2: System comparison (LLaMA-2-7B, $\rho=0.9$)**

| Method | Accuracy (%) | P99 Latency (ms) | Throughput (tok/s) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| SnapKV | 67.1 | 342 | 1240 |
| H2O | 66.8 | 358 | 1180 |
| StreamingLLM | 71.3 | 311 | 1350 |
| FlexGen | 84.2 | 287 | 1420 |
| vLLM + Offload | 86.5 | 203 | 2100 |
| MATDO (3D, no Engram) | 95.2 | 176 | 1950 |
| **MATDO-E (4D)** | **97.8** | **142** | **1880** |

MATDO-E achieves the highest accuracy and lowest latency. The 3D variant (no Engram) already outperforms prior methods, highlighting the benefit of joint $(R,M,T)$ optimization; Engram provides the additional wall postponement.

### 5.4 Arbitrage Effectiveness

With estimated $\zeta=0.35$, $\eta=0.5$, $E_{\max}=128\text{K}$, $\mathcal{E}_{\text{target}}=0.05$, the arbitrage inequality (5) evaluates to:

$$0.35 > \frac{0.5}{128000 \times 0.05} \approx 0.000078 \quad \checkmark$$

The context wall shifts from 0.95 to 0.99, as predicted.

### 5.5 Ablation on Coupling Terms

To assess the impact of ignoring coupling terms in the asymptotic analysis, we compare the predicted $\rho_{\text{ctx}}$ with and without $\delta,\epsilon$. The absolute difference is less than 0.02 across all models, corresponding to a relative shift under 2% of the wall position (Appendix D), which justifies omitting these terms in the closed-form derivation.

## 6 Limitations and Future Work

- **Error model additivity:** Real LLMs may exhibit multiplicative interactions between quantization and scope reduction. Our online RLS estimation partially mitigates this, but a more expressive error model could improve accuracy.
- **Static Engram:** The current Engram table is built offline. Online updates and incremental indexing are important for dynamic knowledge domains.
- **Bandwidth modeling:** Our compute budget abstracts both FLOPs and memory bandwidth into a single $\mathcal{B}_{\max}$. Future work should separate bandwidth constraints for finer-grained latency prediction.
- **Batch scheduling:** MATDO-E optimizes per-request resource allocation. Integrating with batch-level schedulers (e.g., continuous batching) is a natural extension.

## 7 Related Work

**KV cache offloading systems.** vLLM [23], FlexGen [22], LMCache, and NVIDIA Dynamo provide robust infrastructure for moving KV caches between GPU and CPU. These are engineering solutions; our work provides the mathematical theory for deciding **how much** to offload and **when**.

**Academic scheduling theory.** IBM/RPI [25] formalize KV cache placement as an optimization problem but only consider a single dimension (data placement). SparseServe [26] combines sparsity with offloading. Our $(R,M,T,E)$ framework unifies these dimensions and yields closed-form optimality conditions.

**Test-time adaptation.** TTT [4] and qTTT adapt model parameters at inference. Our analysis reveals the **quadratic cost explosion** when adaptation is used to compensate for memory pressure—a previously unrecognized phenomenon.

**Hardware-level approaches.** H2M2 [27] and HeMA-MISO propose hardware modifications. Our theory operates at the software–hardware interface and can inform the design of such architectures.

**Positioning.** MATDO-E is the first work to provide a **unified, provable resource theory** for adaptive LLM inference across four coupled dimensions. The arbitrage inequality offers a principled alternative to heuristic offloading policies.

---

## 8 Conclusion

We introduced MATDO-E, a continuous resource model that abstracts LLM inference optimizations into four knobs $(R,M,T,E)$. Within this framework, we proved the existence and ordering of dual critical points, derived the quadratic divergence of adaptation cost near the context wall, and established a practical arbitrage condition for heterogeneous memory allocation. Experiments on three model families validated the theory and demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy, latency, and memory scalability.

This work lays a **mathematical foundation** for scheduling adaptive LLM inference under resource constraints. We hope the $(R,M,T,E)$ abstraction and its associated theorems will guide the design of next-generation serving systems.

## Appendix B: Proof Sketch of Theorem 4.2 (Convex Duality)

We summarize the dual argument used in Section 4.2.

Let $x=1/M$, $y=1/\sqrt{T}$, and $z=1/E$ for $E>0$. Under a concave relaxation of $f(E)$, the objective and constraints are convex in $(x,y,z)$ over the feasible region with $x,y,z \ge 0$. Slater's condition holds when there exists a strictly feasible point under the HBM/DRAM/compute budgets, so strong duality applies.

Define the Lagrangian with multipliers for error and resource constraints. KKT stationarity yields the marginal-balance condition:
$$
\frac{-\partial \mathcal{E}/\partial M}{c_M S d}
=
\frac{-\partial \mathcal{E}/\partial E}{c_E L},
$$
for interior points where both memory constraints are active.

At the boundary $E=0$, compare the directional derivative along increasing $E$. If inequality (5) holds, the derivative is negative and moving to $E>0$ strictly improves the objective while preserving feasibility; if it fails, KKT complementarity keeps the optimum at $E=0$. This establishes the characterization in Theorem 4.2 within the relaxation.

## Appendix C: Online RLS Parameter Estimation

We estimate $\theta=[\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\eta]^\top$ online using recursive least squares with forgetting factor $\lambda \in (0,1]$.

Feature vector at request $t$:
$$
\phi_t=
\left[
2^{-2R_t},
\frac{f(E_t)}{M_tS},
\frac{1}{\sqrt{T_t}},
\frac{2^{-2R_t}}{M_t},
\frac{\ln M_t}{T_t},
g(E_t)
\right]^\top,
$$
where $g(E_t)=0$ if $E_t=0$ and $g(E_t)=1/E_t$ otherwise.

Given observed error $e_t$, updates are:
$$
K_t = \frac{P_{t-1}\phi_t}{\lambda + \phi_t^\top P_{t-1}\phi_t},
\quad
\hat\theta_t = \hat\theta_{t-1} + K_t\left(e_t-\phi_t^\top\hat\theta_{t-1}\right),
$$
$$
P_t=\lambda^{-1}\left(P_{t-1}-K_t\phi_t^\top P_{t-1}\right).
$$

In experiments we use $\lambda=0.95$ and initialize $P_0=\kappa I$ with large $\kappa$.

## Appendix D: Additional Experimental Data

This appendix reports compact supplementary summaries used in Section 5.

1. **Coupling-term sensitivity.** For each architecture, removing $(\delta,\epsilon)$ from Eq. (1) changes predicted $\rho_{\text{ctx}}$ by less than 0.02 in absolute value (i.e., under 2% relative shift in wall position) in our fitted regime.

2. **Wall-shift consistency.** The context-wall shift from baseline to MATDO-E is 0.06 (LLaMA-2), 0.07 (Mistral), and 0.05 (Qwen), consistent with the arbitrage interpretation.

3. **Latency trend near wall.** Across all models, latency remains smooth at moderate $\rho$ and rises sharply when policies require larger $T$, consistent with the $(\rho_{\text{ctx}}-\rho)^{-2}$ scaling trend.
